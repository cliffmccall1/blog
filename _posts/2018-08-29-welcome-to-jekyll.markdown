I don't know if anyone is a fan of "The IT Crowd." The character Maurice Moss has a wonderful intro to the beginning of an episode where it appears he is in front of one of a "scared straight" group. He ends his little spiel with, "So, what's my story? How'd a brother get here?" He ditches his tough persona and resumes his normal characteristics. Which if you haven't seen is quite geeky.

So.. How did I get here? What's my story? And... Who would care?

Normally I spend my day talking to an audience of one. That one is myself, and it is a bunch of randomness. Where not much amounts to a complete thought. So, why bother?

In my head, this will be a blog of self loathing and stories of me just straight-up not beilieving in myself.

Maybe, this is something I'm scared of doing because my whole life people told me I was creative. Is this the shot I take to prove them right or do I expose myself as a fraud? I have put my hands in so many things and even labeled myself a quitter. I wrote myself off, that I was only someone who attached to dreams of my friends. To be enough just to support their dreams and hope to ride on their coat tails to success.

The biggest encouragement I ever received from a friend was when he told me I wasn't a quitter. He called me a trier. That I was someone who has had multiple opportunities to find themself, and when the opportunity arose I would grab at it. I would put my best foot forward, and when that adventure was over I knew when to step down from it.

That made me look at my life differently. To look back on your life and where you once saw failure; there was actually growth.

This is the moment of truth... Where one puts their thoughts, their story, and a piece of them on the internet to be fully exposed and have random people judge them. When this thing graces the world wide web (which is quicker to say than www) I will still be me. Someone who is possibly tyring something new, and if you count this blog post. Well, I already am. The question is, when will I try something else?
